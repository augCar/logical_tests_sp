## _Logical Problems_

This repository contains three logic issues that were requested in the ServicePad company's backend test. They have pretty simple solutions. Even so, I tried to play a little with the imagination and good practices when developing them, with the aim that these programs are not only a sample of how to solve a problem using an algorithm, but also of what is the best way to document a function.
All three programs have a linear complexity of O(n), depending directly proportionally, the time of its execution according to the amount of data that is entered.

- The three programs were developed by me: Augusto Carmona Perez
