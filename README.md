# ServicePad
## _Logical Problems_

This repository contains three logic issues that were requested in the ServicePad company's backend test. They have pretty simple solutions. Even so, I tried to play a little with the imagination and good practices when developing them, with the aim that these programs are not only a sample of how to solve a problem using an algorithm, but also of what is the best way to document a function.
All three programs have a linear complexity of O(n), depending directly proportionally, the time of its execution according to the amount of data that is entered.

## Installation

This project uses [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run.

Before the instalation, you sould create a Virtual Environment in order to install dependencies.
All the requirements are in the requirements.txt file

*Note: activation process varies depending on the operating system, this command is for Window's Powershell*

```sh
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment venv
C:\> <venv>\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##### Once installed, you can run the command 'pytest' to run test cases.

- The three programs were developed by me: Augusto Carmona Perez
